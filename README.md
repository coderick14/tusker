### What's the difference between `check` and `del`?
Use `del` if you'd *never* like to look back at a completed task.  
Use `check` if you want the satisfaction of seeing the ✓  beside your completed task for a while.
Also, you can `uncheck` it anytime, in case you missed out on something :(

### Tip
Add `tusker show` at the end of your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `config.fish` to get reminded about your pending tasks whenever you fire up a terminal.

### Why tusker?
- No dependencies. Seriously.
- Simple. So that you can focus on what's important, which is **finishing your tasks**.

### Features and contributions
`tusker` was written a couple of nights before my semester examination because I kept forgetting the topics that I had skipped. So if you find a bug or you'd like to add a feature, feel free to raise an issue or send a pull request!!

### Note
I've tried to make the script *POSIX compatible*. However, if you do face an issue regarding that, please raise an issue. Or send a PR *(even better)*!!
